“Bigger is always better and more beats less.” This has been the mantra of US consumers for decades. Driven by the explosion of baby boomers and conspicuous consumption the variety of things available in any given category is astonishing! And overwhelming….

You only have to stand in the coffee section of a grocery store or on the racetrack of any department store to see the sea of selection that stands at the ready to satisfy your latest craving. This is especially true in the apparel category. More brands, more lifestyles, more products, fits and colors than the mind can absorb. All aimed at winning that all important share of wallet. As the number of consumers and their respective spending have grown, the number of stores, brands, products and channels has also grown in a desperate attempt to supply that spending growth with options.

But several things happened on the way to the winners circle!!! The market changed, purse strings tightened. Supply of options overran demand and large surpluses of brands, products and even stores resulted. The demand for large quantities of stacked shirts shifted into a more fragmented demand for truly differentiated products. The consumer market began to shift from “consuming boomers” to “individualized X’ers and Millennials”. Stores at every level of distribution are struggling with this shift. How does a store format designed to showcase variety, shift to a more curated offering of the “right stuff”?

## 1. Understand

There are a few things about this seismic shift that we should understand. First, is that the age of consumers driving the marketplace dynamics is not going away. Retailers, brands, manufacturers and even materials suppliers have had their turn in the driver’s seat. That seat is now occupied by a consumer who is more knowledgeable, discerning and powerful than ever before, and they are using the evolving technology to make their needs known. Secondly, this consumer’s wants and needs are drastically different from the boomer generation that has driven the market for years. They have a greater demand for quality of purchase than quantity of purchase. After a brief fling with fast fashion, they are searching for the “best of the best” rather than the “most of the most”. They value authenticity, expertise and artisanry and are in search for brands and products that reflect their personal lifestyle/viewpoint rather than some manufactured and fictional aspiration. Finally, the emerging consumer leadership is both intensely loyal and fickle at the same time. They value authenticity, true innovation and a common social consciousness as “the ties that bind”. However, they have a much shorter attention span having grown up in a “15 second world” in which things are “liked” or “edited” quickly. The days of spending hours flipping through 100 pages of thumbnail photos are over.

## 2. Shift Strategy

Stores and brands need to quickly digest the fact that the old strategy of variety does not align at all with today’s consumer. They do not have the desire or the time to digest and dissect large pools of product. They are also looking for &nbsp;more individualized, personalized and custom brands and products that better scratch their “FOR ME” itch. This consumer demand cannot be satisfied with a variety based strategy. It calls for a more curated approach that highlights the best products for a given consumer and presents them in a compelling and rapidly available way. Walking into any department store today and the separation between the store’s variety strategy and the consumers curation demands is striking. What brand/product is the store advising the consumer to “BUY”? In most stores it can only be discerned by looking at the sale signs. Stores and brands must take a more carefully selective approach that leads the consumer to what is the best proposal rather than simply presenting racks of options and inviting the consumer to sort it out. The problem is….they won’t!!

## 3. Bring Back the Merchants

The lack of a curated assortment was not always a problem for stores. There was a time when every store had experienced merchants that grew into their jobs as experts at both understanding the consumer demands and the available pool of brands and products, carefully matching the two together, presenting it in a compelling way and generating revenue. Both sides of that experience coin are equally critical to getting the curation correct. Today, we have amazing technology that can crunch data and lead us to what the consumer actually is interested in. Data analytics is an amazing tool that can help solve this puzzle. However, there needs to be someone other than a number cruncher to use that information to match expected demand to the proper brand and product and then present it in a compelling way. This is the job of a true merchant!

## 4. Curate the best to be the best….

The consumer of today has spoken. They are not interested in more or in mass. They value themselves as individuals and want to be treated like the intelligent, discerning people that they are. They are willing to reward the stores, brands, products and channels that deliver authenticity, innovation and value with their purchasing dollars. They want to see the “best” on display in all accessible channels and mediums. They have little to no interest in digging through the mass to find the diamond in the mud. They will spend, they will pay more but they prefer a curated and more personal approach that makes them feel like individuals rather than a consuming herd.
