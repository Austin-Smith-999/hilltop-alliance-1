### Overview
[HilltopAlliance.com](http://hilltopalliance.com) is a responsive *static site* with *blog-aware* functionality. As such, it relies on no databases, has no bloat like a content management system would, and loads dramatically faster than most sites with blogging and commenting. It is powered by the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and was coded by hand custom for your business. My understanding from discussions is that Hilltop needs a clean, no-frills, yet bold and serious aesthetic with a simple user interface and basic navigation. The design and interface, then, limit visual clutter and cognitive overload in any way possible. The final iteration of the site has a modern, bold-looking background color (Pantone: Greenery; Hex: #88B14B) with white text set to use the free Google Web Font `Montserrat.`

### Maintenance
#### Updates
Because the site does *not* run on a database and is not powered by a CMS such as WordPress, there should be zero maintenance needed to keep the site protected from malware. No updates needed, no plugins to be reconfigured, no malware to have to pay $50 a month to purchase site protection. *It just works.* It's future-proof.

At the same time, you have the ability to create dynamic content (blog posts) with timestamps. You can also at any time edit any text content on the site in a relatively easy manner, which I will detail in the folllowing steps.

##### 1. Logging in to frontend CMS to make edits or write a new blog post

I have set up a simple backend editor that allows you to make changes to any site text, content or to write a new blog post. To access the editor, you'll need to navigate to `/update.`If you're in your web browser, simply type in http://hilltopalliance.com/update. You should then see the following login screen I have configured:

To make the process easiest for multiple users, there is simply one password and no usernames. You should have received the password by email. If you at any time forget the password, please contact me at hello@cvl.digital.
