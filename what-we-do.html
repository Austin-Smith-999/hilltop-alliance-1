      <h2>1. Strategy</h2>
      <em>A fresh perspective leads to an executable plan.</em>
      <p class="four-up-feature-text">The best decisions aren’t made in a vacuum.  A thorough study of the strengths and weaknesses of your company or brand, an assessment of the competitive playing field and an understanding of the relevant industry and environmental trends leads to a go-forward plan. </p><p>
The first step is understanding your short and long term needs and wants. Fact-based strategic thinking leads to a plan for value creation. </p>
