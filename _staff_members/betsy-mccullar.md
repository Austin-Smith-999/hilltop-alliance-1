blurb: 'Betsy McCullar develops and executes practical marketing and strategy solutions for brands and businesses. Beginning her career in retail, Betsy left a boutique advertising and public relations firm for Forstmann, then the largest U.S.’ wool manufacturer, where she was director of strategic planning and communication. She began consulting more than a decade ago with the Jassin-ORourke Group, after Forstmann’s turnaround and emergence from bankruptcy. Her roster of clients has included brand owners and diversified manufacturers and associations across North America, Europe, Central America, Mexico and Asia. Recent focus has been on transactional due diligence, turnaround strategies and crisis communication.  Recent focus has largely been on working with a UK-based private equity group focused on investment opportunities where maximum long term value can be achieved by turning around under-performing brands and leveraging emerging market distribution.'
