  Betsy McCullar develops and executes practical marketing and strategy
  solutions for brands and businesses. Beginning her career in retail, Betsy
  left a boutique advertising and public relations firm for Forstmann, then the
  largest U.S.’ wool manufacturer, where she was director of strategic planning
  and communication. She began consulting more than a decade ago with the
  Jassin-O'Rourke Group, after Forstmann’s turnaround and emergence from
  bankruptcy. Her roster of clients has included brand owners and diversified
  manufacturers and associations across North America, Europe, Central America,
  Mexico and Asia. Recent focus has been on transactional due diligence,
  turnaround strategies and crisis communication. Betsy is working with a
  UK-based private equity group seeking investment opportunities where maximum
  long term value can be achieved by turning around under-performing brands and
  leveraging emerging market distribution. Email Betsy at
